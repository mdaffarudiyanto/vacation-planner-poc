  "itinerary_markdown": "Okay, the user wants a 4-day Tokyo itinerary with concise bullet points. Each day needs 3-5 items, a local food tip, and a transport hint. Let me start by outlining the main attractions in Tokyo.\n\nDay 1 should probably hit the iconic spots. Maybe start with the Imperial Palace, then Asakusa for a traditional feel. Senso-ji Temple is a must there. For food, melon pan is a classic. Transport tip: use Suica card for convenience.\n\nDay 2 could focus on Akihabara and Shibuya. Akihabara for electronics and anime, then Shibuya for the crossing. Robot Restaurant might be fun. Local food like okonomiyaki in Shimbashi. Take the Yamanote Line for easy transfers.\n\nDay 3 might be nature and temples. Meiji Shrine and Yoyogi Park in the morning. Then Harajuku for fashion and Omotesando. Evening at Shinjuku Gyoen. Matcha desserts in Harajuku. Use the JR Pass for the park.\n\nDay 4 could be modern Tokyo. Mori Art Museum for views, then Roppongi Art District. End with a sushi dinner in Ginza. Transport tip: Ginza Line for quick access. Local food: omakase sushi.\n\nNeed to check word count and ensure each day has the required elements. Make sure food and transport tips are specific and practical. Avoid any markdown, keep it under 180 words.
