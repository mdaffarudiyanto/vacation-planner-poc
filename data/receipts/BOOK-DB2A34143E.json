  "itinerary_markdown": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a concise 3-day itinerary for Singapore. Let me start by breaking down the main attractions and ensuring each day has 3-5 items. They need a local food tip and a transport hint each day, and the total should be under 180 words.\n\nFirst, Day 1: Maybe start with Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay. Then the ArtScience Museum. For food, hawker centers like Maxwell are good. Transport: Skytrain to Gardens by the Bay.\n\nDay 2: Cultural spots. Chinatown and Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Then Clarke Quay for the night. Local food could be a chili crab at Jumbo. Transport tip: MRT to Chinatown.\n\nDay 3: Nature and shopping. Sentosa Island with Universal Studios and S.E.A. Aquarium. Local food: nasi lemak at a hawker center. Transport: Sentosa Express from MRT.\n\nCheck word count. Make sure each day has bullets, tips, and hints. Avoid fluff. Maybe trim some descriptions to stay under 180 words. Let me count the words now. Yeah, that should fit. Double-check the food tips and transport hints are included each day. Looks good.\n</think>\n\n**Day 1**  \n\u2022 **Gardens by the Bay** \u2013 Walk through Supertree Grove and Flower Dome.  \n\u2022 **Marina Bay Sands SkyPark** \u2013 Panoramic city views.  \n\u2022 **Hawker Center** \u2013 Try *char kway teow* at Lau Pa Sat.  \n\u2022 **Transport Tip**: Take the free Skytrain from Marina Bay.  \n\n**Day 2**  \n\u2022 **Chinatown** \u2013 Visit Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Maxwell Chambers.  \n\u2022 **Clarke Quay** \u2013 Riverfront dining and night views.  \n\u2022 **Local Food**: Chili crab at Jumbo Seafood (book ahead).  \n\u2022 **Transport Tip**: Use MRT to reach Chinatown; walk to Clarke Quay.  \n\n**Day 3**  \n\u2022 **Sentosa Island** \u2013 Universal Studios or S.E.A.
